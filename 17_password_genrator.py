# Advances password genrator in python with the help of random module
# A  strong password should be like 
# At least 8 charactersâ€”the more characters, the better.
# A mixture of both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# A mixture of letters and numbers.
# Inclusion of at least one special character, e.g., ! @ # ? ] Note: do not use < or > in your password, as both can cause problems in Web browsers.
